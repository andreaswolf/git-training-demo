This is just a demonstration file. Its contents are rather... well... for
demonstration purposes, so really, what do you expect? We could begin quoting
Shakespeare, but for now, I'll leave it as is.

You could add some more content to this file and commit the changes, probably
one change after the other, to see what Git does with it and how it affects
the history.
